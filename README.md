* 12/01: Made one example on Mnist but not working
* 14/01: DCGAN on mnist worked 50 epochs
* 15/01: DCGAN on fashion worked for 50 epochs
* 16/01: Generation of monsters from Binding of Isaac. Not too bad but problem of overfitting
* 17/01: dofus scraping done
* TO DO : more scraping on TOP websites
